# FitbitHUD

App for use on a Fitbit Versa 2 to work as a basis for a Heads Up Display (HUD).

Currently in early development, working on getting streaming video for camera passthrough at the moment.

Other use cases are planned, such as an inset terminal GUI, among other things.

Also using this as a project to learn some of the fundamentals of working with Javascript.

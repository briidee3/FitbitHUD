# FitbitHUD

App for use on a Fitbit Versa 2 to work as a basis for a Heads Up Display (HUD).

Currently in early development, working on getting streaming video for camera passthrough at the moment.

Other use cases are planned, such as an inset terminal GUI, among other things.

Also using this as a project for me to learn some of the fundamentals of working with Javascript.

Here's the general idea for what I wanna do here:
> I plan to use my Fitbit Versa 2 watch (along with a 3d printed chassis to hold all the components together
> that I plan to design in the future) as a Heads Up Display (HUD). My plan with this in this case was to utilize the
> WebRTC library to manage communication between the Fitbit Versa 2 watch app/companion (what runs on the phone) app
> and something along the lines of a Raspberry Pi Zero W 2 and/or a ESP32 camera so as to stream the camera's picture 
> data to the watch and potentially add (an) overlay(s), along with other features (such as zooming in; actually, the
> original inspiration for the whole Fitbit HUD thing was because I wanted to be able to "zoom in" my vision in class
> to get a better view of the board, lol).

*This project is currently on hold (as you may have noticed), however, I do plan to return to it (relatively) soon*
